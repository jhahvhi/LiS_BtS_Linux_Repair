# Repair script for LiS BtS

Script to automatically repair Life is Strange Before the Storm on Linux.
A few years ago I played the game. Now, I wanted to play it again, but when I downloaded it and started playing, it didn't open, it just ran for a few seconds and then stopped. Finally, after a lot of searching on the internet, thanks to a thread on the Steam forum, I was able to solve it. I also saw other possible solutions on reddit, which didn't work for me. In the end I will leave all the sources praised. Since it took me several hours to find the bug and fix it, I decided to create this script to automate it.

**Instructions:**

**-** Install the game through steam normally

**-** Press the gear button -> manage -> view local files

**-** Paste the script in that folder

**-** Run the script
